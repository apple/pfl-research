    Run training/evaluation and gather aggregated model updates and metrics

        The :class:`~pfl.algorithm.base.FederatedAlgorithm` to use.
        Implements local training behaviour and central model update behaviour.
        Note that some algorithms are incompatible with some models.
    :param backend:
        The :class:`~pfl.aggregate.base.Backend` to use to
        distribute training of individual users and aggregate the results.
        Can be used for simulation or live training with the infrastructure.
