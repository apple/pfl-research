    Backend that simulates an algorithm on the given federated datasets.
    The simulation performs the following:

    1. Perform the following steps on all users (can be parallelized with
       multiple workers):

       (a) Sample a user ``Dataset`` from the source ``FederatedDatasetBase``.
       (b) Train model on the user dataset and extract the model updates.
            The algorithm used for local training is injected by
            ``training_algorithm`` when calling ``gather_results``.
       (c) Apply local clipping to individual contribution.
       (d) Privatize individual contribution with ``local_privacy``.

    2. Apply central clipping of individual contribution.
    3. Sum all the individual contributions.
    4. Add central noise.

        Steps for postprocessing statistics returned by users, e.g. weighting,

        The aggregation method to use. If not specified, use the default
        :class:`pfl.aggregate.base.SumAggregator` which will sum all
        statistics of users trained in each process, then all-reduce sum
        across processes.

        Simulate overshooting the number of results received from users. This
        is disabled by default, but is expected to be up to 0.05-0.10 when
        training live.
        The overshooting is assumed to be a fraction

        Run a simulation on a cohort of user datasets.
        Returns aggregated statistics and metrics from the procedure described
        in the class description.

        This implementation is not actually asynchronous and it yields execution
        only once it is completely done.
        The work may be split up amongst multiple workers.
        In this case, the order in which this method is called must be the same
        across workers, so that their synchronisation points line up.

            A model to be used for gathering the statistics.
        :param training_algorithm:
            An object that inherits from

            which injects the algorithm-specific behaviour.

        :returns:
            A dictionary of the raw model updates and a metrics object
            of aggregated statistics. The model updates are weighted depending
            on the weighting strategy. The model update can be ``None`` if the
            algorithm does not train on the val population.

            If using local and central DP, useful privacy metrics with the
            category "local DP" and "central DP" are returned.
            Metrics from training are returned with the population as the
            category.
            ``number of devices`` is the number of users
            that the data came from.
            ``number of data points`` is self-explanatory.
