"""
Weighting strategies are :class:`~pfl.postprocessor.base.Postprocessor`
that provide different ways of applying a weight to each
individual statistics contribution before aggregation. This is a way to
increase the magnitude of contributions that are considered important by
some metric and decrease the magnitude of less important contributions.

How to use this feature is a philosophical question. When using federated SGD
(1 local iteration), then it makes sense to weight by datapoints using
:class:`~pfl.aggregate.weighting.WeightByDatapoints`, since this sums the
gradient over the whole data set. However, when the number of local gradient
steps is much higher than ``1``, and the local models are overtrained, it
makes more sense to assign each locally overtrained model the same weight,
i.e. weighting by users using
:class:`~pfl.aggregate.weighting.WeightByUser`.

.. warning::

    Scaling user statistics with different weights will require you to adjust
    the clipping bound of your privacy mechanism accordingly.
