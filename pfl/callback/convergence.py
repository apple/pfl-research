class ConvergenceCallback(TrainingProcessCallback):
    """
    Track convergence using a performance measure and stop training when
    converged.

    Convergence is defined as when the performance becomes better than
    a threshold and afterwards stays that way for `patience`
    iterations. If the run is terminated, a new metric is added that
    stores the number of data points processed until the convergence
    was achieved (when the metric reached the threshold for the
    first time).

    :param metric_name:
        The name of the metric to track for convergence.
    :param patience:
        The run will be terminated when the metric `metric_name` is better
        than `performance threshold` for at least `patience` iterations.
    :param performance_threshold:
        The performance required to start considering whether training has
        converged.
    :param performance_is_better:
        A binary function that returns true if the first argument,
        indicating a performance level, is "better" than the second
        argument.
        For accuracy metrics, this is normally `operator.gt`, since higher
        is better.
        For loss or error metrics, lower is better, and this should be set to
        `operator.lt`.
