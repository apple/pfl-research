    Given an array of labels, create a partitioning representing artificial user
    dataset splits where each user's class distribution is sampled ~Dir(alpha).

    It is common to use `alpha=0.1` (majority of samples for each user will be
    from 1 class). See S.J. Reddi et al. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00295.pdf,
    J. Wang. et al https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07481.pdf

    :param labels:
        A one-dimensional array of all labels (integers). Classes should be
        consecutive non-negative integers starting at 0, i.e. from
        {0, 1, ..., num_classes-1}.
    :param alpha:
        The alpha parameter for Dirichlet distribution.
    :param user_dataset_len_sampler:
        A function which samples the dataset length of the user to construct
        next. E.g., use ``lambda: 25`` to sample 25 data points for all users.
    :param spread_distribution_after_num_fails:
        When there are few datapoints left to sample, there might not be any
        datapoints left to sample for particular classes.
        Each (user_num_datapoints * spread_distribution_after_num_fails)
        iterations of sampling each user, even out the class distribution by
        adding `spread_distribution_after_fails_percentage` to each class
        probability and normalize (this will make the distribution less
        heterogeneous and move it closer to the uniform one).
        This will normally only start occurring when there are only a few
        datapoints left to sample from.
    :param spread_distribution_after_fails_percentage:
        See above how this works with ``spread_distribution_after_num_fails``.
        E.g., the default value 0.02 increases each class probability by
        2% and then renormalizes to ensure that the probabilities sum to 1.
        This moves the distribution closer to the uniform one. E.g., for 2
        classes with probabilities [0.1, 0.9] we end up adjusting to
        [0.12, 0.92] first and then normalize to [0.11538462, 0.88461538].
    :returns:
        A list, where each element is a list of ``label`` indices that
        represents one sampled user.
