class SNRMetric(MetricValue):
    """
    A signal-to-noise metric for the Gaussian mechanism.

    The "signal" is defined as the L2 norm of all statistics after clipping
    but before adding the DP noise. Thus, the maximum value of the signal
    is equal to the norm clipping bound.
    The "noise" is defined as the L2 norm of the vector of standard deviations
    of noise added to each statistic. Since the noise added to each parameter
    has the same standard deviation `noise_stddev`, the overall noise is
    defined as `sqrt(num_dimensions) * noise_stddev`.

    All objects of type ``SNRMetric`` form a commutative monoid
    (with ``+`` as the operator).
    Intermediate values maintain two values.
    The first is the sum of L2 norms from each data vector.
    Note that the implicit assumption is that each data vector is in the same
    direction, which is usually an overestimate.
    The second is the sum of expected squared errors.
    Note that the expected standard deviation of the noise can be computed from
    this, but it does not sum.
    (This is the reason that local DP with the Gaussian mechanism can be useful
    at all.)

    :param signal_l2_norm:
        The L2 norm of the data vector.
    :param squared_error:
        The expected squared L2 error that the mechanism has added to the
        signal. This is summed over all elements of the vector, i.e.
        it is equal to num_dimensions * noise_stddev**2 where noise_stddev
        is the standard deviation of Gaussian noise added to each
        statistic.
